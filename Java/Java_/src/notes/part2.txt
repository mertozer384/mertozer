16. OOP: Object Oriented Programming
		code reusability
		centralized structure
		easy to maintain
		less duplication
		less memory usage
		clean

	Encapsulation: data hiding by giving private AM
				   use public getter/setter to read/write the private data

				   getter: read ONLY
				   setter: write ONLY

17. Inheritance: Building IS A relation (parent & child) between classes
			
			Class X  extends  Class Y
				 sub				super

			Class Z extends Class Y
				  sub			 super


		  sub class: can inherit all the visible variables & methods from super class

		  super class: can not inherit anything from sub class

		  A class can only extend one class

		  A class can be extended by multiple classes


	    TestBase
			  driver

			@BeforeMethod  {
			  open the browser
			  maximize the Browser
			  use implicit wait
			  navigate to URL
			  }


	    TestClass1 extends TestBase

	    TestClass2 extends TestBase

	    TestClass3 extends TestBase

    	=================

    	BasePage class
    		constructor(BasePage)(){
    			PageFactory.initElement(driver, this )
    		}

    	other pages extends BasePage:

    		@FindBy(xpath = "")
    		WebElement name;


	CarTask
			ElectricCar:
				charging()

			LuxuryCar
				massage();
				seatHeater();
				seatCooler();


			Abstract Car
				make, model, color, year, price..
				drive(), toString()
				start();


			Toyota extends Car

			Honda extends Car

			Mercedes extends Car implements LuxuryCar

			BMW extends Car implements LuxuryCar

			Tesla extends Car implements LuxuryCar, ElectricCar




18. Is A relation VS Has A relation

		Is A relation: if the classes are in inheritance relation
			class Car{

			}

			class Toyota extends Car{     Toyota Is A Car

			}


		Has A relation: if the class is used in another class that does not have Is A relation

			ParkingLot{     ParkingLot Has A Toyota
				Toyota
				Car

			}


19. Method Overriding: giving different implementation to the method

						MUST happen in subclass

						returnType, methodName, Parameters MUST be same

						Access modifier MUST be same or more visible

						we cannot override:
								final, private, static



20. Final keyword: unchangeable

			variables: can not be reassigned

			methods: cannot be overridden

			class: cannot be inherited



21. Abstraction: hiding the implementation details
				 focus on essentials without worrying about small details


				 Abstract method: method without the body
				 				  meant to be overridden (can not be final, private, static)

				2 ways:
					1. abstract class: meant to be super class (can not be final)
									  can not create object

									  abstract class can have all the methods & variables of regular class can have
                        ex:
                        Selenium-   BasePage,TestBase


					2. interface: blueprint of the class, meant to be implemented (cannot final)
									public is the only access modifier
									cannot create object


						ex:
						Selenium-	WebDriver, WebElement, JavaScritpExecuter, TakeScreenShot...
						Database-	Connection, Statement, ResultSet...
						API-		Response, RequestSpecification, ResponseSpecification...


22. abstract class vs interface:
			
			- one class can extend one abstract class only
			- one class implement multiple interface
			- one interface can extend multiple interfaces



23. Polymorphism: ability of the object taking on many forms
				
				parent being referenced to child objects

				reference type decides which are accessible

				object type decides which implementation to be executed

		Driver
			WebDriver getDriver(browserName){

			}


		WebDriver driver;
		( (TakeScreenShot)driver ).takeScrenShot
		( (JavaScriptExecuter)driver ).executeScript

        ex:
		List list=new ArrayList();
		List list=new LinkedList();
		Set set=new HashSet();
		Set set=new TreeSet();



24. Reference type casting:
TakeScreenShot screen=new ChromeDriver();

((WebDriver)screen).get("https://www.google.com");


WebDriver driver=new ChromeDriver();
TakeScreenShot screen=(TakeScreenShot)driver;
screen.takeScrenShot();
			
			up casting: casting the smaller type to larger type (automatically done)

			down casting: casting the larger type to smaller type (manually done)



25. Exceptions: checked or unchecked
		
		unchecked exception: occurs during the runtime

		checked exception: occurs during compile time

	throw: used for manually throw exception


26. Exception handling ways:

			1. try & catch blocks: can handle unchecked & checked

					try{
						exception codes
					}catch(ExceptionType){
						e.printstackTrace()	
					}

			2. throws: can handle checked exception. used within the method signature



27. final vs finally vs finalize:
		
		final: keyword

		finally: block

		finalize: method



29. Collection: size is dynamic. only supports non-primitives
		
		List (I): accepts duplicates, has index

			ArrayList (C): Array based class. retrieving the data is faster ( get() )

			LinkedList (C): doubly linked. adding & removing are faster

			Vector (C): synchronized ===> thread-safe

			Stack (C): synchronized ===> thread-safe. LIFO ( pop() )


		Set (I): does not accept duplicates, does not have index

			HashSet (C): order is not guaranteed

			LinkedHashSet (C): keeps the insertion order

			TreeSet (C): ascending order. 


		Queue (I): accepts duplicates, does not have index. FIFO ( poll() )
				


30. Map (I): key & value. key cannot be duplicated. dynamic sized. no index
		
		HashMap (C): order is random, accepts null

		LinkedHashMap (C): insertion order is kept as it is. accepts null

		HashTable (C): order is random, does not accepts null. synchronized==> thread-safe

		TreeMap (C): ascending order, does not accept null
